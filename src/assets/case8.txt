Hello? I’m Craig Smallwood. I want to sue, and I heard you could help...

I don’t even know where to start because I’m so frustrated. I have spent YEARS playing Lineage II. I put in time, effort, and money to build my characters, make connections, and enjoy the game. It was a huge part of my life, but then out of nowhere, NCSOFT completely IP banned me.

According to them, I engaged in schemes to create real money transfers, but that’s bullshit! And what’s worse, they didn’t even give me a chance to defend myself. Just silence. A maze of automated responses and scripted nonsense, making sure I could never get a straight answer.

This isn’t just about some $65 of pre-paid game time they stole from me (which, by the way, is theft). This is about the fact that they destroyed something I loved and left me with nothing. I suffered extreme emotional distress, so much so that I was hospitalized, and need to go to therapy three times a week.

To make it even worse, it’s obvious why they did it. They wanted to push people to Aion. They wanted to build hype for their new game at the expense of loyal Lineage II players like me. They locked me out, not because I broke the rules, but because they wanted to make more money. That’s disgusting. That’s unfair. And I won’t stand for it.

I want to sue for 8 counts: (I) Misrepresentation/Deceit; (II) Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices; (III) Defamation/Libel/Slander; (IV) Negligence; (V) Gross Negligence; (VI) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (VII) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress; and (VIII) Punitive Damages.

So, are you going to help me?
