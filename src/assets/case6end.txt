What happened in the real world:

The FTC v. AT&T Mobility LLC case (2014) centered on allegations that AT&T misled customers by throttling unlimited data plans without proper disclosure. AT&T had advertised unlimited data but slowed speeds significantly after customers exceeded a certain threshold. In October 2014, the FTC sued AT&T for deceptive business practices, claiming over 3.5 million customers were affected, with speeds reduced by up to 90%. AT&T defended itself by arguing that as a common carrier, it was regulated by the FCC, not the FTC. In 2015, the Ninth Circuit ruled in AT&T’s favor, limiting FTC oversight. The FTC appealed in 2017, but before the case could be decided, the FCC reclassified broadband services under Title II of the Communications Act in 2018, making AT&T a common carrier entirely and mooting the case. This raised concerns about the FTC’s ability to regulate.
