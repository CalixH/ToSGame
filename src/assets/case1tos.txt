No, you shouldn't email them. The clause specifically states that "A special consideration... will be awarded to a limited number of authorized licensees," which implies that not everyone is eligible for this offer. If you are unsure whether you meet the criteria, emailing the company could be seen as unnecessary or even a violation of the terms, especially if you're not an authorized licensee. Additionally, since the offer can be withdrawn at any time, you might not receive a response or might be informed that the offer is no longer available, making the effort potentially futile.

@Yes, you should email them. Based on the clause in the Terms of Service, you are being given the opportunity for special consideration, which may include financial compensation. The clause specifically invites a "limited number of authorized licensees" to read that section of the agreement and make contact. If you are eligible, taking action may lead to compensation or other benefits. However, this offer can be withdrawn at any time, so it's important to act before the opportunity is no longer available.
