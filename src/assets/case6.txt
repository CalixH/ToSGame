Hey,

Thanks for your help thus far.

We’ve got a case against AT&T. They sold ‘unlimited’ data plans but secretly throttled speeds once customers used too much. That’s deception. Your job? Go through these documents—customer complaints, internal emails, marketing claims. Find the contradictions, expose the lies. AT&T argues we have no authority because they’re a ‘common carrier.’ If they win, they set a precedent for other companies to do the same. We need solid proof that they misled customers. If we fail, millions get nothing. No refunds, no justice. The truth is in these files. Find it, and make sure AT&T answers for their actions.
