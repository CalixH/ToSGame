Here are the deceptive statements and why they can be harmful:

"By using our service, you agree that we may collect, use, and sell your personal dataâ€”including financial and browsing historyâ€”to any third party we choose."
ðŸš© Why it's deceptive: This grants the company unrestricted rights to sell sensitive data.

"We may change these terms at any time without notifying you, and continued use of our service constitutes your acceptance of any changes."
ðŸš© Why it's deceptive: Users could unknowingly agree to unfavorable terms without any warning.


"You waive your right to participate in any class-action lawsuit or arbitration against us, regardless of any damages suffered."
ðŸš© Why it's deceptive: This strips users of legal recourse, making it nearly impossible to challenge unfair practices.
