Hey,

I just installed PC Pitstop and was going through their End User License Agreement when I found this clause that looked odd.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATION

A special consideration which may include financial compensation will be awarded to a limited number of authorize licensee to read this section of the license agreement and contact PC Pitstop at consideration@pcpitstop.com. This offer can be withdrawn at any time.

Is this legally binding? I can't tell if it's a joke, or if they would steal my information if I email them...
